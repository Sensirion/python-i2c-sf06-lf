Click [here](https://sensirion.com/products/product-categories/liquid-flow/) to learn more about the Sensirion SF06-LF sensor family.


Not all sensors of this driver family support all measurements.
In case a measurement is not supported by all sensors, the products that
support it are listed in the API description.



## Supported sensor types

| Sensor name   | IÂ²C Addresses  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
|[SLF3C-1300F](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SLF3C-1300F/)| **0x08**|
|[SLF3S-1300F](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SLF3S-1300F/)| **0x08**|
|[SLF3S-0600F](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SLF3S-0600F/)| **0x08**|

|[LD20-2600B](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/LD20-2600B/)| **0x08**|

The following instructions and examples use a *SLF3C-1300F*.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/sensirion-products/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
